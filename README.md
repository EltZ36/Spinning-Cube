# Spinning-Cube
Coded using the p5.js library. You will need to use or import the p5.js library in order to run it on a website I think. I haven't used p5.js besides on codepen.io which is what I recommend to use for this project. Warning: The shape moves very fast and I don't advise staring at it for too long.
