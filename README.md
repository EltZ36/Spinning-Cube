# Spinning-Cube
Coded using the p5.js library. You will need to use or import the p5.js script in order to run it on a website. I haven't used p5.js besides on codepen.io which is what I recommend to use for this project or you can use the p5.js ide to run it. It should be able to run a website however, I haven't tested it out just yet. 
Requirements: p5.js library and WEBGL
Warning: The shape moves very fast and I don't advise staring at it for too long.
